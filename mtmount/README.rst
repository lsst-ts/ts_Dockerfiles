In order to create this docker container locally you must first copy a folder named "TeknikerSoftware" from Chile IT Network Drive. You can obtain access to the drive by asking an IT member from Chile. Once you have access navigate to "TSS-Share" and copy over the "TeknikerSoftware" folder into the root directory of this repo. You may nay rebuild th Docker image, remember not to publicly share the contents of this folder. The "TeknikerSoftware" folder has been added to the .gitignore.
