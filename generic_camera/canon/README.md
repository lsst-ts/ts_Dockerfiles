# GenericCamera all-sky

Be patient when this Docker image is building. 
It is based on 64 bit CentOS 7 and both updates of the installed packages and new packages will be downloaded and installed. 
Then Python 3.8 and several Python modules get installed via MiniForge.

The Docker image is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4. 
When running a container for the image, a Raspberry Pi with more memory than 1 Gb will give a better performance.
