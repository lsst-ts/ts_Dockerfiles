VI Package Manager (VIPM) is Copyright JKI

Installing VIPM for Linux:

Copy the folder /JKI and all the contents to /usr/local
You may need root access to do this.

VIPM for Linux depends on the LabVIEW 2015 SP1 run-time engine which is provided with this distribution. It's located in the LabVIEW2015SP1RTE_Linux folder. You must install all the RPM files located there. If you have trouble installing the run-time engine, please contact National Instruments (http://ni.com/support). Note: If you have the LabVIEW 2015 SP1 full development system already installed on your system, then you probably don't need to install the run-time engine since you already have it installed.

Running VIPM for Linux:

VIPM for Linux must be run with admin or root level privileges. There is no way around this. If you run VIPM as a standard user, it will not work as expected and will generate errors. To do this, navigate to the installation folder at /usr/local/JKI/VIPM and execute the following:

$ sudo ./vipm

You will be prompted for your root password. Enter the password and VIPM will launch.
