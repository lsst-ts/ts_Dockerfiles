suppliers.&nbsp; The Product is protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret 
and other proprietary rights of JKI, and you do not acquire any rights, express 
or implied, in the Product, other than those specified in this Agreement.&nbsp; 
No title to or ownership of the Product, nor any copyright, trademark, trade 
secret or other proprietary rights in the Product, are transferred to you under 
this Agreement.&nbsp; All modifications, adjustments, enhancements, bug fixes, 
error corrections or other updates to the Product will become part of the

<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp; Use of Third Party Software:&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>You understand that the Product is a software package 
management tool that accesses, interacts with and/or utilizes software object 
and/or source code obtained by JKI from third parties and that is separate from 
the Product (the "Third Party Software").&nbsp; (For purposes of this Agreement, 
the Product and any Third Party Software shall be referred to as the 
"Software".)&nbsp; Together with its distribution to you of the Product, JKI is 
making some Third Party Software available to you via download or other 
distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, following your installation of the 
Product, the Product will be able to and will, based on your instruction, 
connect to the internet and identify additional Third Party Software for 
download and installation on your computer on your behalf.&nbsp; This 
identification and installation process will require you to provide certain 
information, including information about the Product as installed on your 
computer, all of which information will be gathered and used by JKI in 
accordance with its Privacy Policy then in effect. You understand and agree that 
all such Third Party Software is made available to you by JKI for the sole 
purpose of facilitating your download, installation and use&nbsp; of the Product 
as permitted herein.&nbsp; You further acknowledge and agree that your use and 
distribution of any such Third Party Software is subject to the terms of the 
applicable Third Party Software license(s), and that you will comply with the 
terms of such Third Party Software license(s). You expressly acknowledge and 
agree that, prior to using the Third Party Software for any other purpose, and 
in any case before copying, modifying, or distributing any Third Party Software, 
you will confirm that you have all necessary rights and permissions to do so 
from the applicable third party licensor (the "Licensor"), which confirmation 
may include obtaining a separate license from the Licensor expressly authorizing 
you to do so.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp; You Will Not Use nor Disclose Our Confidential 
Information.&nbsp; Confidential Information hereunder includes, but is not 
limited to, JKI Product specifications, Product source code, trade secrets, 
know-how, inventions (whether or not patentable), techniques, processes, 
programs, ideas, algorithms, schematics, testing procedures, software design and 
architecture, internal documentation, design and function specifications, 
product requirements, analysis and performance information, benchmarks, software 
documents, and other non-public technical, business, product, marketing and 
financial information, plans and data of JKI (the "Confidential 
Information").&nbsp; You agree that all Confidential Information is the 
confidential property of JKI and, except with JKI's prior written consent or as 
required (and then only to the extent required) by law, you agree to use any 
Confidential Information you obtain only as permitted by this Agreement, and not 
to disclose any Confidential Information to third parties.&nbsp; Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, you may disclose Confidential Information only to those of your 
employees and consultants as is necessary for the use expressly and 
unambiguously licensed hereunder, and only after such employees and contractors 
have agreed in writing to be bound by the obligations of nondisclosure at least 
as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Your nondisclosure 
obligations hereunder shall not apply to information you can document: (i) is 
generally available to the public other than through breach of this Agreement; 
(ii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any associated 
obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) is independently developed by you 
without use of any JKI Confidential Information. Because of the unique and 
proprietary nature of the Confidential Information, you understand and agree 
that JKI's remedies at law for your breach of your obligations under this 
Section may be inadequate and that JKI shall be entitled to seek equitable 
relief (including without limitation provisional and permanent injunctive relief 
and specific performance). Nothing stated herein shall limit any other remedies 
provided under this Agreement or available to JKI at law. Upon expiration or 
termination of this Agreement for any reason, you will return or destroy all 
copies of all JKI Confidential Information in your possession or control.</P>

feedback regarding your use and evaluation of the Product, including any defects 
found therein and any recommendations for changes or modifications to the 
Product (the "Feedback"). Such Feedback may include, but will not be limited to,

the nature of that use, (3) the extent or amount of use, (4) any errors or 
difficulties discovered and (5) the characteristic conditions and symptoms of 
the errors and difficulties.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that (i) JKI may 
use, in any manner and for any purpose, the information gained as a result of 
your use and evaluation of the Product, including but not limited to the 
Feedback;&nbsp; (ii) any corrections, modifications, upgrades or improvements to 
the Product based on such Feedback or other input shall be owned and retained 
entirely by JKI; and (iii) JKI shall have no obligation to correct, upgrade, 
modify, or otherwise support or maintain the Product pursuant to this 
license.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>4.2&nbsp; Assignment.&nbsp; If you are ever held or deemed to 
hold any right, title or interest (including, without limitation, any 
intellectual property rights, moral rights or trade secret rights) in or to: (a) 
the Product (including any changes, modifications or corrections thereto) and/or 
(b) the Feedback, whether by virtue of your provision of Feedback to JKI or 
otherwise, then you hereby irrevocably assign to JKI all such right, title and 
interest. Such assignment includes all rights in or to any invention, work of 
authorship, mask work, idea, information, feedback or know-how (whether or not

performance under this Agreement and any patent rights, copyrights (including 
moral rights; provided that any non-assignable moral rights are waived to the 
extent permitted by law), trade secret rights, mask work rights, sui generis 
database rights and all other intellectual and industrial property rights of any 
sort with respect thereto that in any way relate to or constitute the Feedback 
or the Product. In the event that any such rights (including, by way of example 
and without limitation, "moral rights," or other similar rights) cannot be 
assigned, you hereby agree to waive enforcement worldwide of such rights against 
JKI and hereby grant to JKI an exclusive, fully paid, worldwide, irrevocable, 
perpetual license, with right to sublicense through multiple tiers of

publicly display, transfer, assign and distribute in any medium or format, 
whether now known or later developed, any and all property that is subject to 
such rights.&nbsp; You agree to take any action reasonably requested by JKI to 
evidence, perfect, obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the foregoing, including 
executing any and all documents necessary to implement and confirm the letter 
and intent of this Agreement.</P>
